# Linux Kernel Learning

This repository is to keep track of my steps learning about the Linux Kernel and Linux Kernel exploitation techniques. I might be adding random notes on various aspects of the Linux kernel, exploits of known vulnerabilities that I write myself as a means of learning (don't expect breakthrough research), tricks that I learn along the way, or just anything that I might want to write down for future reference.

## Exploits

- [CVE-2022-0185](./cve-2022-0185/)

## Notes

- [Creating an Ubuntu VM with Kernel Debug Symbols](./notes/ubuntu-qemu-vm.md)
- [Deferred work](./notes/deferred-work.md)
